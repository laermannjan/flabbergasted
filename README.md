# Flabbergasted for [Vim](http://vim.org)

> A dark theme for [Vim](http://vim.org).
Based on a cool, blu-ish color palette, with the intent to be easy on the eyes.
Inspired by [panic](github.com/jdsimcoe/panic.vim) with some tweaked colors.
Designed to work well with iTerm and the color scheme of the [fish](http://www.fishshell.com) default theme.
